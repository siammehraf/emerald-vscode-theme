# VS Code Custom Theme & Editor Configuration

This repository contains a custom Visual Studio Code settings configuration focused on providing a dark, earthy green-themed UI with smooth editor behavior and enhanced readability.

## Features

- **Dark Earthy Green Backgrounds:** Custom background colors for the editor, sidebar, activity bar, status bar, and title bar that give a consistent dark, nature-inspired aesthetic.
- **Tab Styling:** Active and inactive tabs share the same dark background color, with a subtle active tab border and a hover background color to improve visual feedback.
- **Explorer Styling:** Customized sidebar titles, section headers, and list item selections to blend well with the dark green theme.
- **Editor Behavior:**
  - Word wrap enabled for better readability.
  - Smooth caret animation and cursor blinking.
  - Mouse wheel zoom enabled for quick font size adjustment.
  - Auto-format on save using Prettier, with Prettier configured as the default formatter.
